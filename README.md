# Art_Generation_with_Neural_Style_Transfer
Neural Style Transfer (NST) is an optimization technique in deep learning. It merges two images, namely: a "content" image (C) and a "style" image (S), to create a "generated" image (G). The generated image G combines the "content" of the image C with the "style" of image S.
